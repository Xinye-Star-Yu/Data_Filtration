# Data_Filtration

This script takes an excel file with a list of EMDB IDs in the first column and returns a new excel file with the EMDB IDs and their corresponding resolution. Replace excel_path and output_path with the path to the input and output respectively. Note that depending on what operating system you are using you may have to change the format of the file path in the code.
